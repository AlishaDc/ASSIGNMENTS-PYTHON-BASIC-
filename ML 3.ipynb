    "# Q1.\n",
    "Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics, and use cases include customer churn, credit card fraud, and email spam. ML tasks are learned through available data that were observed through experiences or instructions, which in turn result in better learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are many ethical challenges: Lack of transparency of AI tools: AI decisions are not always intelligible to humans. AI is not neutral: AI-based decisions are susceptible to inaccuracies, discriminatory outcomes, embedded or inserted bias. Surveillance practices for data gathering and privacy of court users."

This guidance or supervision trains the learner to solve certain type of problems but not as easily as under supervision. Problems can range from formal communication, to mathematical calculations. Expert indirect guidance provide for only limited rectifications and course correction during learning.\n",

    "Ethics : The idea of trusting data and algorithms more than our own judgment has its pros and cons. Obviously, we benefit from these algorithms, otherwise, we wouldn’t be using them in the first place. These algorithms allow us to automate processes by making informed judgments using available data. Sometimes, however, this means replacing someone’s job with an algorithm, which comes with ethical ramifications.\n",

    "Data : Many machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data before they begin to give useful results. A good example of this is a neural network. Neural networks are data-eating machines that require copious amounts of training data. The larger the architecture, the more data is needed to produce viable results. Reusing data is a bad idea, and data augmentation is useful to some extent, but having more data is always the preferred solution.\n",

    "Supervised learning In supervised learning, the machine is taught by example. The operator provides the machine learning algorithm with a known dataset that includes desired inputs and outputs, and the algorithm must find a method to determine how to arrive at those inputs and outputs. While the operator knows the correct answers to the problem, the algorithm identifies patterns in data, learns from observations and makes predictions. The algorithm makes predictions and is corrected by the operator – and this process continues until the algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy/performance.

    "Unsupervised learning Here, the machine learning algorithm studies data to identify patterns. There is no answer key or human operator to provide instruction. Instead, the machine determines the correlations and relationships by analysing available data. In an unsupervised learning process, the machine learning algorithm is left to interpret large data sets and address that data accordingly. The algorithm tries to organise that data in some way to describe its structure. This might mean grouping the data into clusters or arranging it in a way that looks more organised. As it assesses more data, its ability to make decisions on that data gradually improves and becomes more refined. Under the umbrella of unsupervised learning, fall:\n",
