Groups can be created by clustering together individual data points using clustering machine learning models. When clustering is done, feature importance can be used to find the variables contributing most to the clustering and on the basis of that, a working theory or hypothesis can be made about underlying trends and patterns. Example: Clustering can be done using individuals from different countries to find underlying trend about differences in life expectancies and mortality rates."

    "# i. In the sense of machine learning models, what is underfitting? What is the most common reason for underfitting?\n",
    "Underfitting is a situation arising when the hypothesis is way too simple, has poor generalizability, and when the machine learning model is way too simple to produce good results. Underfitting causes a model to produce poor results due to heavily simplified algorithm reacting lightly to changes in the unseen data for independent variables from the training data. Underfitting is also called High Bias.\n",

    "# ii. What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen?\n",
    "Overfitting is a situation arising when the hypothesis is way too complex, or when the machine learning model is way too complex to produce good results. Overfitting makes a model produce poor results due to slightest variations in the unseen data for independent variables from the training data. Overfitting is also called High variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common reason for overfitting is small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# iii. In the sense of model fitting, explain the bias-variance trade-off.\n",
    "Bias means simplifying the model so that the resultant target function has better generalizability. Variance means change in result from target function when training data differs. If during model fitting, model is kept too simple and has few parameters then the resultant model is high bias and low variance model. If during model fitting, model is kept too complex and has large number of parameters then the resultant model is high variance and low bias model. Either of the two conditions leads to incorrect results after training phase. We need to balance between these two situations by using techniques that minimize both high variance and high bias. This is the bias-variance tradeoff."

Transforming datapoints into higher or lower dimension, or simply into features that can be used better for training phase and creating new features from existing features is called Feature Engineering. Support Vector Classifier uses kernels for implicit feature transformations, also called kernelization. Techniques like SMOTE is used for creating new datapoints.\n",

The exact opposite happens in backward feature selection."
