    "1. Mathematically, Prior Probability can be defined as the Probability of event A occurring. P(A). We can calculate the probability of getting afflicted with Covid-19 without any additional information would put us in a box and we would simply have to calculate the probability using the entire population of the world.\n",
    "2. Mathematically, it can be defined as the Probability of a point x such that it belongs to a certain class label. In above example, with more information like the information regarding the country and state we wish to talk about for Covid-19 infection, we will change or adjust our probability. In this case, probability calculated after getting more information is posterior probability.\n",
    "3. Mathematically, it can be defined as the Probability of event B (P(B)) given that event A has already occurred. Probability of getting a heads in a toss will be prior probability. But, calculating the conditional probability of the coin giving heads given that the coin was biased will be likelihood."
